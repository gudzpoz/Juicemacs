     *  to the ISO week, without century.

     *  (%h is not supported on MS-Windows.)
     * %d is the day of the month, zero-padded, %e is blank-padded.
     * %u is the numeric day of week from 1 (Monday) to 7, %w from 0 (Sunday) to 6.
     * %a is the locale's abbreviated name of the day of week, %A the full name.
     * %U is the week number starting on Sunday, %W starting on Monday,
     *  %V the week number according to ISO 8601.
     * %j is the day of the year.
     *
     * %H is the hour on a 24-hour clock, %I is on a 12-hour clock, %k is like %H
     *  only blank-padded, %l is like %I blank-padded.
     * %p is the locale's equivalent of either AM or PM.
     * %q is the calendar quarter (1â€“4).
     * %M is the minute (00-59).
     * %S is the second (00-59; 00-60 on platforms with leap seconds)
     * %s is the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000.
     * %N is the nanosecond, %6N the microsecond, %3N the millisecond, etc.
     * %Z is the time zone abbreviation, %z is the numeric form.
     *
     * %c is the locale's date and time format.
     * %x is the locale's "preferred" date format.
     * %D is like "%m/%d/%y".
     * %F is the ISO 8601 date format (like "%+4Y-%m-%d").
     *
     * %R is like "%H:%M", %T is like "%H:%M:%S", %r is like "%I:%M:%S %p".
     * %X is the locale's "preferred" time format.
     *
     * Finally, %n is a newline, %t is a tab, %% is a literal %, and
     * unrecognized %-sequences stand for themselves.
     *
     * A %-sequence can contain optional flags, field width, and a modifier
     * (in that order) after the `%'.  The flags are:
     *
     * `-' Do not pad the field.
     * `_' Pad with spaces.
     * `0' Pad with zeros.
     * `+' Pad with zeros and put `+' before nonnegative year numbers with &gt;4 digits.
     * `^' Use upper case characters if possible.
     * `#' Use opposite case characters if possible.
     *
     * A field width N is an unsigned decimal integer with a leading digit
     * nonzero.  %NX is like %X, but takes up at least N positions.  The
     * field width is (on GNU/Linux and some other systems) in measured in
     * bytes, not characters.  It depends on the locale what the width (in
     * characters) %NX will end up being, especially when there are non-ASCII
     * characters in %X.
     *
     * The modifiers are:
     *
     * `E' Use the locale's alternative version.
     * `O' Use the locale's number symbols.
