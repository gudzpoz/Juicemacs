* TODO [#A] Strings & Buffers

For string processing in any language, I suppose there are always at least two
kinds of offsets: char offsets & code point offsets. Emacs basically uses byte
offsets and codepoint offsets, but Java uses UTF-16 char offsets and codepoint
offsets. So to correctly handle strings in Juicemacs, we need to incorporate all
these three kinds of offsets.

It could be easier if we could just follow Emacs. (And Truffle actually provides
a byte-offset based =TruffleString= to free us of the trouble!) But,
unfortunately, we can't. There is one indispensible Java API we need to use:
Java =Pattern= regex, which, of course, is based on UTF-16 char offsets.

** TODO [#A] RegExp

Well, the conclusion is that we need to implement a new RegExp runtime. :)

*** Thoughts

Truffle also provides a JIT-compiling RegExp runtime (TRegex). But we still need
to experiment whether it is compatible with Emacs Lisp RegExps.

* TODO [#A] Initialization logic & ordering

The initialization logic of Emacs is quite complex. Basically:

- Every =.c= file may contain a =syms_of_<part>= that contains the definition of
  the symbols, variable initialization logic that this file manages.
- Some may contain an =init_<part>= function that is called initialize...
  things.
- Some may contain multiple =init_<part>_<wut>= functions that contains
  initialization instructions that must be run separately due to
  interdependencies between all those initialization logic.

The =main= function in =emacs.c= contains a dazzling amount of initialization
code. (Search for =init_alloc_once= to start reading.) Thank you, Emacs
developers for all those helpful comments around the init function calls. But,
no, I would really want to avoid all these complex dependencies between code
"modules".

The question is: is simplifying all this "mess" ever possible or the Emacs
=main= initialization is the best we can get?

(One thing that comes to mind is dependency injection or inversion of control.
But I'm afraid that the dependencies are not that simple or that OOP-friendly.)

* TODO [#B] Make functions mutable

Currently in GNU Emacs 29, a function may be a =lambda/closure= cons:

#+begin_src elisp :results value code
  ;;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
  (defalias 'my-func #'(lambda () 42))
  (symbol-function 'my-func)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src elisp
(lambda nil 42)
#+end_src

With lexical binding, you will get =(closure (t) nil 42)= instead of =(lambda
nil 42)=.

Since it is a cons, you may modify it to change the function definition on the
fly. For the GNU Emacs interpreter, since it literally evaluates the cons, it is
fine. But for Truffle interpreters, which usually wants a static AST for better
JIT performance, this is bad news.

Currently, we don't bother checking whether each AST node needs update and the
function may be considered immutable once the whole AST is constructed. (One
exception is that we check at each cons node =(maybe-function arg1 ...)= whether
the target function is changed so as to handle subroutines, functions as well as
macros.) Also, with our interpreter, =(function (lambda ()))= produces =<a
closure object>= instead of a cons, which is another behavioral difference.

The current performance is pretty good and we might consider adding more checks
to ensure a consistent behavior. But we will need some benchmark to ensure it
does not slow down too much.

* TODO [#B] Understanding Non-Bare Symbols

I hope we can make all symbols bare.

* TODO [#B] =obarray=

Oh no. It looks like a data structure with its internal structure /fully
exposed/ as a vector. It probably means we will /have to/ exactly follow the GNU
Emacs implementation.

Edit: No, it is not fully exposed. (See keymaps for what is fully exposed...
Sigh.) It is a hash-table-ish thing. And actually, I do think we can make all
/hashes/ zeros and use our own =HashMap= instead.

* TODO [#B] Autoload

So basically one can have autoload functions as well as autoload strings
(docstrings). What else?

* TODO [#B] Threading preparations

- Limit =jdk.virtualThreadScheduler.parallelism= to =1=.

* TODO [#C] Charsets & Coding

Emacs MULE.

The most significant properties of charsets seem to be:

- Mapping between byte-sequence and character code
- Mapping between character code and Unicode codepoint

The mappings are stored in files generated from glibc charset data files.

* TODO [#C] Keymaps

I now know there are sparse maps and dense ones, and they nest. And keymaps are
index by character codes most of the time. However, I have seen it indexed with
=[t]=. No idea what it is all about.

Edit: See comments in =BuiltInKeymap.java= for what keymap is about.

* TODO Buffers

It is still a long long way to go... But at least we have a piece table now. I
might still need to look into CRDTs and the new Eg-walker if we want to merge
buffers from different (virtual) threads.

* TODO Syntax tables & case tables

It seems basically a char table. However, in order to use it with RegExp, we will need to
maintain a character set for each syntax class, which might take quite some memory if unoptimized.

* PENDING Conforming RegExp

It depends on:

- Syntax tables
- Case tables
- Buffers (to match the pointer position)

* Trackers

** Language [3/6]

- [X] Emacs Lisp reader (lexer & parser)

- [X] Buffer-local variables & scoping

  Basically, in addition to buffer-local variables, forwarded variables, etc.,
  we want to add transparent "thread-local" variables, so that:

  - Dynamically bound variables are thread-local, during the lifetime of which
    other threads sees the original value.
  - Some specific variables must be thread-local to make transparent
    concurrentization work.
  - Also, lexical scopes are always thread-local.

* Considered Done (For Now)

** DONE [#A] Signals

A central mechanism to handle exceptions.

I guess I should start implementing it before I litter
=IllegalArgumentException= everywhere.

- [X] =signal/error/condition-case=

  - [X] Implementation

  - [X] Error groups

  - [X] Store debug info into cons nodes.

  - [X] So we want function names in stack traces, but all interpreted functions
    are just lambdas in Emacs: =(defalias 'a-symbol #'(lambda () ...))=. Maybe
    we can try to assign a lambda a name when it is first bound to a symbol? (<-
    chose this approach)

    +I will need to check out how GraalJs handles lambdas.+ Too lazy to do that.

** DONE [#B] Replace lexical scope maps with Truffle frames

- Threefold speed-up: =(fib 35)= went from ~5s to 1.7s. At least we are not
  slower than interpreted GNU Emacs now (~3s).
  - Any other languages I tested takes less than an instant.
  - Python 3.12 takes ~0.6s. So it is quite embarrassing that a JIT
    implementation cannot beat an interpreted language.
    - JMH results: =~0.4 s/op=, probably jacoco is interfering with previous
      results.
    - But... =(mandelbrot 750)= takes around 5.5s while Python uses only a
      second. So there is definitely space for improvement. (Emacs: ~30s.)

*** Reusing frame slots

Basically, each Truffle function automatically gets its own =VirtualFrame=, and
for each lexical scope (either in a function or a =let/let*= scope), we manually
assign a =ELispLexical= scope.

Lexical scopes are append-only and keeps track of mappings between variables in
the current scope and their frame slots. When the current lexical scope is
materialized (when a lambda function is created inside it, for example), it
marks the corresponding frame materialized. However, instead of treating all
frame slots as not reusable slots, it makes use of a =materializedTop= slot to
track what slots that lambda function might have access to, allowing slots
beyond those slots to be reused.

** DONE [#A] Undertanding =Lisp_Symbol= (Variables)

I really doubt I get the implementation of =ELispSymbol= wrong (to some degree).
Basicall, a =symbol= can:

- Contain a lisp value (plain value symbol)
- Point to a field in a global C struct (forward symbol)
- Point to a field in a buffer struct (buffer-local symbol)
- Contain a user-defined buffer-local symbol (buffer-local symbol)
- Point to another symbol (aliased symbol)

Also, similar to Java, lisp functions and values are in different "namespaces".
So in the function namespace, a =symbol= can:

- Point to a C function
- Point to a lisp function
- Point to another symbol (aliased function)
- Other special values:
  - Macros
  - Autoload functions
  - Wait, what? A keymap?
- Other values set by =defalias=

I have no idea how all these things interacts. (For example, what happens when
you try to set the buffer-local default value for a plain value symbol? What if
it is lexically bound? What behaviors may change if a symbol is lexically bound?)

(Did I forget to mention that symbols like =:keyword= are automatically
constant? Or are they? They also seems to evaluate to themselves.)

*** Lexical Scoping

#+begin_quote
Note that unlike dynamic variables which are tied to the symbol object itself,
the relationship between lexical variables and symbols is only present in the
interpreter (or compiler). Therefore, functions which take a symbol argument
(like ‘symbol-value’, ‘boundp’, and ‘set’) can only retrieve or modify a
variable’s dynamic binding (i.e., the contents of its symbol’s value cell).

=C-h i g= =(elisp) Lexical Binding=
#+end_quote

Oh. Great.

*** DONE =defvar=

#+begin_quote
If INITVALUE is missing, the form marks the variable "special" locally (i.e.,
within the current lexical scope, or the current file, if the form is at
top-level).
#+end_quote

Mind-boggling. No idea. (And why? Is it just fun to change the whole semantics
depending on a single missing parameter?)

*** DONE =let= and =let*=

Dynamic binding not handled yet. Also, still need to handle "special == true"
symbols under lexical scoping.

Wait. Does "special == true" also applies to function arguments?
