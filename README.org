Juicemacs is a work-in-progress Emacs implementation +just for the fun of it+
that over-ambitiously aims to explore the following:

- Speculative JIT compilation
- Transparent(-ish) concurrentization of ELisp code
- Polyglot programming with Python, JavaScript, etc.
- GNU Emacs 30 compatibility

Java helps to make all these possible, for it runs on JVM, which happens to be a
platform with several nice things:

- A decent GC: HotSpot has a number of state-of-the-art GCs.
- Green threads & OS threads: One without the hassle of function coloring.
- An incredible JIT framework: [[https://www.graalvm.org/latest/graalvm-as-a-platform/language-implementation-framework/][Truffle]] lets you build an interpreter and a JIT
  compiler all at once.

Of course using Java brings in its own problems, which this project will need to
live with:

- Sloooow startup (and with Truffle, it actually needs two warm-ups)
- It bloats (and we can only hope Project Valhalla somehow tackles that)

* Running

Currently, Juicemacs has two functional interpreters (one for AST, one for
bytecoed) and enough built-in rountines implemented to handle =pdump=. It
usually stops when =top-level= tries to use unimplemented UI subroutines.

To run it:
1. Make sure to have JDK 23 installed (preferably [[https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases/][graalvm-ce]]).
2. Clone the repository, go to [[file:elisp/emacs/]] and build a GNU Emacs to have
   all the generated data/elisp files ready.
3. Run src_bash{sh -c "cd app && $(./gradlew -q :app:jvmCmd)"} (in the project root) for
   a REPL.

By the way, you may also try:
- src_bash{sh -c "cd app && $(./gradlew -q :app:jvmCmd) --help"}
- src_bash{sh -c "cd app && $(./gradlew -q :app:jvmCmd) --inspect=4242"} (for a
  [[https://www.graalvm.org/latest/tools/chrome-debugger/][Chrome DevTools protocol server]])

And specially, if you want to try out the experimental slowish pdump:
- src_bash{sh -c "cd app && $(./gradlew -q :app:jvmCmd) --dump=pdump"}
- src_bash{sh -c "cd app && $(./gradlew -q :app:jvmCmd) --dump-file=../emacs.pdmp"}

** ERT Testing

Emacs comes with a unit-testing toolkit, Emacs Lisp Regression Testing (ERT),
and has a bunch of ELisp tests in its source repository (=./test/src/=).
Juicemacs currently can run some of these tests [[file:elisp/src/test/java/party/iroiro/juicemacs/elisp/ELispLanguageTest.java][with a bit of workaround]]:

#+begin_src elisp
  ;; TODO: pp requires a bunch of sexp parsing functions
  (require 'pp)
  (defalias 'pp 'princ)
  ;; ert asserts about newlines produced by pp
  (defun cl--assertion-failed (&rest _) t)

  (require 'ert)
  (load "../test/src/data-tests")
  (ert-run-tests-batch)
  (null (ert-run-tests-batch)) ; don't print the huge info object
#+end_src

You're welcome to try the tests and report any failing cases! (I think many of
them might simply throw an =UnsupportedOperationException= since they are yet to
be implemented.)

things that need more work.

* Disclaimers

By calling this project Juicemacs, I do mean that:

- It does not aim to become a solid implementation (yet).
- It is not bug-free ([[https://www.fda.gov/food/current-good-manufacturing-practices-cgmps-food-and-dietary-supplements/food-defect-levels-handbook][~5 Drosophila eggs per 250 ml]]).
