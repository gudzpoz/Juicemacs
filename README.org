#+title: Juicemacs - An absolutely-not-solid Emacs implementation

Juicemacs is a work-in-progress Emacs implementation +just for the fun of it+
that over-ambitiously aims to achieve the following:

- Transparent(-ish) concurrentization of ELisp code
- Polyglot programming with Python, JavaScript, etc.
- GNU Emacs 30 compatibility

To make all these possible, I have chosen to build Juicemacs on Java, which runs
on JVM, which happens to be a nice platform with:

- A decent GC: HotSpot has a number of state-of-the-art GCs.
- Green threads & OS threads: One without the hassle of function coloring.
- An incredible JIT framework: [[https://www.graalvm.org/latest/graalvm-as-a-platform/language-implementation-framework/][Truffle]] lets you build an interpreter and a JIT
  compiler all at once.

Of course using Java brings in its own problems, which I (and, probably, this
project) will need to live with:

- Sloooow startup (and with Truffle, it actually needs two warm-ups)
- It bloats (and we can only hope Project Valhalla somehow tackles that)

* Disclaimers

By calling this project Juicemacs, I do mean that:

- It does not aim to become a solid implementation (yet).
- It is not bug-free ([[https://www.fda.gov/food/current-good-manufacturing-practices-cgmps-food-and-dietary-supplements/food-defect-levels-handbook][~5 Drosophila eggs per 250 ml]]).
