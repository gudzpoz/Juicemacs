This website hosts several documentation files in the Juicemacs repository,
because the Org files are very often rendered incorrectly.

Currently, we have the following documentation:

#+begin_src elisp :exports results :eval yes
  (require 'cl-macs)
  (cl-loop
   for pattern in '("*.org" "*/*.org") append
   (let ((pattern (file-name-concat default-directory pattern)))
     (cl-loop for file in (file-expand-wildcards pattern) collect
              (list (format "[[file:%s][%s]]" file
                            (file-relative-name file default-directory))))))
#+end_src

#+INCLUDE: "./README.org" :lines "1-10"
